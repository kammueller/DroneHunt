## Where do I find what?
- server: the Server
- controller-app: The app which controlls the Parrot Jumping Race and takes the pictures
- Drohnenhandy: The simulated display of the drone
- UserApplication: The User app

## Inspiration
HackaTUM Project: Motivate people to visit tech stores using gear
-> Idea: Scotland Yard with a drone as Mr. X

## What it does
provides three apps (a user-app, an app to controll the parrot jumper drone and a app which simulates the display of the drone) and a server.

## How we built it
with lots of motivation and to little sleep

## Challenges we ran into
- challening SDKs & APIs
- hardware problems of drones and roboters
- android specific errors

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- we programmed a drone which sends pictures to a server
- the app is nearly the way we wanted to have it
- we all learned something new

## What we learned
- Android and Java are not the same
- Pay attention to the features of the drone you buy
- not every Robot who claims to be the same accepts the same interfaces

## What's next for DroneHunt
The project is promising for a real-market-scale application, to realize the Event would be cool.
But before that, we'll get some sleep _Zzzzzzzz_
